# Streamtoy test game

This is a small test game that connects to a [StreamToy](https://github.com/deep-entertainment/godot-stream-toy) server
and subscribes to twitch events.

If a twitch event is received, a short bbcode-label animation is presented.

This is a reference implementation of a StreamToy frontend and will be the base of a game template.
